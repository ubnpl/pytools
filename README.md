# pytools 
simple tools for data handling and analysis in python

repository for preliminary tool collection

	!!WORK IN PROGRESS!!

This repository contains examples of how to solve various data analysis problems using python libraries. 

The examples are presented as Jupyter Notebooks: http://jupyter.org

We recommend installing Python and Jupyter using the conda package manager. The miniconda distribution provides a minimal Python and conda installation: http://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html

Additional installation instructions for Python libraries required by different tools can be found in the corresponding Jupyter Notebooks.
